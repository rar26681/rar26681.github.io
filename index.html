	<p><b>Bob Ross</b> was a very interesting man even before his fame. As a child he had a pet <b>alligator</b> that lived in his bathtub in Florida. His love for animals is the reason he is known for bringing creatures like <b>squirrels</b> onto his show with him. After growing up he joined the <b>Air Force</b> where he rose to master sergent where he learned his discipline developed good bossing skills.</p>
	<P>After <b>retiring</b> to become a painter he was having very little success and was low on money. He decided to get a perm so he wouldn't have to waste time worrying about his hair: this was the start of half of the reason he got famous, the <b>afro</b>. He actually hated the afro but his career took off on <b>television</b> very quickly because of his funny look and soothing voice. Apparently he brought his air force training to work with him though, and most of his workers <b>disliked</b> him for that. He was very demanding of the workers, and painted each painting <b>3 times</b>: once for an idea, next for details, finally for the camera. And also he meticulously <b>scripted</b> and rehearsed each painting episode. Meaning the Bob Ross you know and love, is really just a character on TV played by the military side of Bob Ross. His art is incredible though, for all the senses.</p>
